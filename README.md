# website
This is my personal website

Hi there :)
I'm still working on the content for my website and fixing small bugs as I go along. This is the template for my website so if you would like to see it in action, you can clone this repository to your computer and run `npm run parcel:build` or `npm run parcel:watch` and then run `node app.js`. You should be able to view website by typing `localhost` or `127.0.0.1` in your browser.
